Applied AI Research Intern Assessment 
Overview 
Build the project for an AI-powered customer support system with a multi-agent architecture. A 
router agent should analyze incoming queries and delegate to specialized sub-agents, each 
with access to relevant tools.The system should maintain conversational context across 
messages to enable more accurate and personalized responses.  
Requirements 
Architecture 
1.  Controller-Service pattern 
2.  Clean separation of concerns 
3.  Proper error handling throughout (Recommended use a middleware) 
Multi-Agent System 
Router Agent (Parent) 
•  Analyzes incoming customer queries 
•  Classifies intent and delegates to appropriate sub-agent 
•  Handles fallback for unclassified queries 
Sub-Agents (implement all three): 
1. Support Agent 
•  Handles general support inquiries, FAQs, troubleshooting 
•  Tools: query conversation history 
2. Order Agent 
•  Handles order status, tracking, modifications, cancellations 
•  Tools: fetch order details, check delivery status 
3. Billing Agent 
•  Handles payment issues, refunds, invoices, subscription queries 
•  Tools: get invoice details, check refund status 
 
Agent Tools 
4.  Each sub-agent must have tools 
5.  Tools should query actual data from database (mock data is enough) 
6.  Seed database with sample orders, payments, conversations 
7.  The agents should have a conversation context. On the User’s previous contexts. 
API & Database 
8.  RESTful API endpoints for chat interactions 
9.  Streaming responses from AI agents (Recommended) 
10. Conversation and message persistence 
11. Real-time agent is typing indicator 
API Routes 
/api 
├── /chat 
│   ├── POST /messages                    # Send new message 
│   ├── GET /conversations/:id            # Get conversation history 
│   ├── GET /conversations                # List user conversations 
│   └── DELETE /conversations/:id         # Delete conversation 
│ 
├── /agents 
│   ├── GET /agents                       # List available agents 
│   └── GET /agents/:type/capabilities    # Get agent capabilities 
└── /health                               # Health check

Bonus Points 
Hono RPC + Monorepo Setup (+30 points Guaranteed) 
Set up a monorepo with Hono RPC for end-to-end type safety between backend and 
frontend. Use https://turborepo.dev/ for monorepo management. 
Other Bonuses 
1.  Rate limiting implementation 
2.  Usage of https://useworkflow.dev 
3.  Unit/integration tests
